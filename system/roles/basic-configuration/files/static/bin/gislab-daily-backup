PREVIOUS_BACKUP_MSG="Dear GIS.lab Administrator.

GIS.lab daily backups are created every day. To prevent low disk space problem,
only one backup copy is stored in time. To keep history, it is required to move
backup files to another storage medium before another backup process is started.
This task is in competence of you as the local GIS.lab administrator.

Now, previous backup files are removed and new backups are just about to be
created. To keep them for future, it is safe to start moving files once
'$BACKUP_DONE_FILE' will appear in
'$BACKUP_DIR'.

Sincerely yours daily GIS.lab backup job.
